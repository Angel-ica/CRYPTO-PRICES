# CRYPTO-PRICEs

This project uses selenium to extract useful data from two competing cryptocurrency websites and compares their prices in GBP, market value and percentage change in prices within a specified time period. DevOps tools like Docker for building and containerising the application and GitHub Actions to create a CI/CD pipeline were then employed to automate and streamline running of the application.
